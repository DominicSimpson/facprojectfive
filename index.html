							<p>For the first project, I constructed a 
								tribute page to Buckminster "Bucky" Fuller, the legendary American architect, 
								systems theorist, futurist, writer, designer, inventor, and philosopher. 
								Fuller is something of a hero of mine, having overcome the odds to be a true visionary 
								whose ideas are still with us today.</p>
							<p>I used Google Fonts to make the headings looks professional and employed Flex Box.  
								I also decided to keep the main section with a white background, because some of the 
								images &#x2013; particularly the Dymaxion car replica and the Dymaxion map projection 
								of the World &#x2013; had white images, and thus would've not have had the same effect 
								if the background colour was not straight white. </p>	 
							<p>Initially, the time and date were at the top, but this did not look quite right, 
								so it put it in the footer section.</p> 
							<p>The links are in blue for accessibility purposes: blue is generally held up as the 
								best colour to have links in, for those who have sight access requirements.</p>

						<div class="cardtext">
							<p>For the third project, I constructed a 
								Comment Box, which employed the same logic as when Tweeting: only a maximum of 140 characters 
								allowed.</p>
							<p>This meant setting up a system on JavaScript where a constant variable with the number 140 was invoked 
								as comparison when the user started typing in characters. This logic was complicated by the fact that 
								the counter was counting down from 140 to 0 rather than up, as well as having to account for what 
								would happen to the counter if the user backspaced.</p>	 
							<p>I constructed an if else statement to account for if the user had reached the 
								limit of 140 characters, with not only the text highlighted in red, but also the walls 
								via the outline property in CSS, which I had not encountered before.</p> 
							<p>Finally, I also construct a print function, which not only printed out what the user 
								had typed in the text area before hitting Submit, but also forced them to fill in 
								the Name field, which was printed out too.</p>

						<div class="cardtext">
							<p>For the fourth project, I constructed a Fruit Shop, with each fruit added to a Cart 
								that displayed on a separate page. </p>
							<p>Each fruit item was linked to a specific object in a Products array in the JavaScript, 
								with an inCart element as one the elements in the object that incremented every time.</p>	 
							<p>A function called displayCart printed out the products on the Cart page, 
								generating the items and price, and calculating a basket total.</p>
