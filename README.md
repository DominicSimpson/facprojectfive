# facprojectfive and #facprojecttwo - Application Website and Project Gallery
###### For my application website and project gallery, which together took up projects two and five as part of my application for Founders & Coders, I decided to use bright, welcoming colours, utilising yellow as the background colour, rather than the more [forbidding black](http://www.dominicsimpson.co.uk) that appears on my own website.
###### As requested, I linked in the Project Gallery cards of the following:
1. Tribute Page to Buckminster Fuller
2. Project Gallery (as part of No5 Application Website)
3. Comment Box
4. Fruit Shop Shopping Page
5. Application Website
6. Feature - Theseus & The Minotaur
I also decided to link to long-existing work on my own website such as my solar system animation.

###### For the paragraph font, I used Roboto Mono font, having seen this used on so many websites successfully.
